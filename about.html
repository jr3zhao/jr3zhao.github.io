## About

Welcome! My name is Jerry and I am currently a junior at the University of Waterloo, studying Computer Science. I am an aspiring software engineer who's interested in web development,
network security, and big data.

This summer, I interned at 360 Education Labs in Toronto as a full stack web developer and mainly worked with Java EE and React.

My passion for programming began in high school, when I was introduced to the first programming language I ever learned, Turing. It was very easy to learn and create graphics with so I used it to create my first project which was a Tic-tac-toe game.
In my senior year, I learned Java and worked on a few more projects, such as Pet Simulator.

When I am not writing code, I enjoy doing photography because it has caused me to fall in love with light and see the world around me with fresh eyes every single day.
